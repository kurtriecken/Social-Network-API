## Description
  
This application is an exercise in creating a back-end to a social media site. The database will store information about users, posts (called 'thoughts'), and reactions to those posts.

## Installation
  
You must have node installed on your machine for this program to run. To check if you have node already installed, run the following code in your terminal:

`node --version`

If you see something like (but perhaps different numbers for another version)

`v18.18.2`

you're all set! If not, enter the following:

`npm init -y`

followed by 

`npm i`

Once you've done that, you are good to go!
  
## Usage
  
Because this application includes only the back-end, there is no GUI or front-end with which you will interact. As such, all you need to do in order to see the app's functionality is spin the server up:

`npm start`

OR

`nodemon`

After your server is running, you should see the following message on your terminal:

`API server running on port 3001!`

To see things work, you can open your favorite API interaction tool. In the demonstration video that follows, we use Insomnia:
